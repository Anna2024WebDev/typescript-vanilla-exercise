# Word Transformer Exercise

## Project Overview
This project is a simple word transformation tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this exercise is to refactor the existing code into TypeScript.

## Current Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file
- `styles.css`: Contains all the styling for the application
- `word-transformer.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for word transformation

## Exercise Goals
1. Set up TypeScript in the project
2. Convert `word-transformer.js` to TypeScript
3. Add type annotations to improve code quality and catch potential errors
4. Ensure the refactored TypeScript code works as expected

## Steps to Refactor

### 1. Set up TypeScript
- Install TypeScript globally: `npm install -g typescript`
- Initialize a `tsconfig.json` file: `tsc --init`
- Adjust `tsconfig.json` as needed (e.g., set `"target": "es6"`)

### 2. Convert JavaScript to TypeScript
- Rename `word-transformer.js` to `word-transformer.ts`
- Do the changes to make it Typescript great! üíÉüèº 

### 3. Compile TypeScript
- Run `tsc` to compile the TypeScript file to JavaScript
- Update the `<script>` tag in `index.html` to point to the compiled JS file

### 4. Test and Debug
- Open `index.html` in a browser and test all functionalities
- Fix any issues that arise during testing

### 5. Optimize and Refactor (Optional)
- Look for opportunities to use more advanced TypeScript features

## Tips
- Start by adding basic type annotations (string, number, etc.)
- Use the `any` type sparingly and only when necessary
- Take advantage of TypeScript's static typing to catch potential errors early

- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) for quick experimentation

Good luck with the refactoring!
